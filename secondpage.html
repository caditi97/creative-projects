         As of now, we don't have much more than the game's title. But Bayonetta 2,
         which debuted on the Wii U and was ported to the Nintendo Switch, was one
         of the strongest titles of its generation. The third part in this loose
         hack-and-slash trilogy, Bayonetta 3, will hopefully keep that tradition of
         excellence alive.

         In the midst of all these new game announcements, Nintendo is quietly
         building its online subscription service, which allows you to play original,
         8-bit NES games. And this January, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987)
         is debuting on the service. Part sidescroller, part bird's eye adventure,
         it was made during a time when Nintendo was still trying to figure out who
         Link was, and what a Zelda game was. This title is as much a historical
         document as it is a game.
